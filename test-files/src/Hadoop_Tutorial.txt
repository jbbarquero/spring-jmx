Hadoop Tutorial

· Overview

An open source Apache project started at Yahoo in 2006. It's a distributed fault-tolerant storage and batch processing. It provides lineas scalability on commodity hardware.

 · HDFS (It stores bytes :) with buit in support for multiple formats.)

It's a hierarchical UNIX-like system for data storge by splitting of large files into blocks (typically XXMB but also YMB and ZMB) that are distributed and replicated to nodes.

It has two key services: a MasterNode and many DataNodes. It also has a checkpoint node (poorly named as Secondary NameNode, it isn't a backup)

- NameNode: single master service for HDFS (it was a single point of failure in HDFS 1.x)

It stores file to block location mappins in the namespace.

All transactions are logged to disk.

At startup it reads namesapce image and logs.

- Checkpoint Node (aka Secondary NN): performs checkpoints of the NameNode's namespace and logs (it isn't a backup)

1. Loads up namespace
2. REads log transactions to modify namespace
3. Saves namespaces as a checkpoint.

- DataNode: stores block on local disk. It also sends frequent heartbeats to NameNode and block reports too. 

Clients connect to DataNode for I/O.

· YARN:

Then lots of projects. Just slice the video.

· Map Reduce primer (Great!)

· HDFS Architechture: from Apache Hadoop site

Principle #1: HDFS is the datalake
Principle #2: Apps share their internal state (through HDFS)
Principle #3: MapReduce is assembly language of Hadoop
Principle #4: Apache Bigtop is how the Hadoop distros get defined

The ecosystem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcuTdJgUFmo&list=PLz2AxTYbff2p9NEE3T_r2liAmNbWuzZKF#t=2237

· HBase
· Crunch, Pig, Hive, Phoenix
· Giraph
· Oozie
· Mahout
· Sqoop, Flume

Principle #6: There are always 3 implementations

· HBase (plus GemFire)

I miss that part

· Querying data
	- Apache Pig: a data manipulation DSL
	- Apache Hive: a batch-oriented SQL on top of Hadoop

	- [Close to] real-time SQL:
		* Impala (inspired by Google's F1)
		* Hive/Tex (AKA Stinger)
		* Facebook's Presto (Hive's lineage)
		* Pivotal's HAWQ

Principle #7: SQL on Hadoop

Principle #8: Spark is the techology of 2014

Principle #9: Hadoop in the CLoud is one of many distributed frameworks
